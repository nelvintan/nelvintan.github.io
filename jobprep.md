Here, I list the resources that I read near the end of my PhD to help prepare with getting a job outside of academia.

- I read "[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)" to get a broad knowledge about the machine learning algorithms out there.
- This [book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) (and its [answers](https://github.com/zafstojano/ml-interview-questions-and-answers/blob/main/ML_interview_questions_and_answers.pdf)) helped to explain how machine learning interview works.
- For a quick recap, I read through this data science [cheatsheet](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf).
- For deeplearning, I read this online [book](https://d2l.ai/).
- For SQL, this free [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) with its cheatsheets ([basics](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS1.pdf)) help. This [cheatsheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6186483/31167166-64f940a6-a8f1-11e7-9213-99be469440fc.png) is also helpful.
