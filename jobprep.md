Here, I list the resources that I read near the end of my PhD to help prepare with getting a job outside of academia.

- I read "[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)" to get a broad knowledge about the machine learning algorithms out there.
- This [book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) (and its [answers](https://github.com/zafstojano/ml-interview-questions-and-answers/blob/main/ML_interview_questions_and_answers.pdf)) helped to explain how machine learning interview works.
- For a quick recap, I read through this data science [cheatsheet](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf).
- For deeplearning, I read this online [book](https://d2l.ai/).
- For SQL, this free [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) with its useful cheatsheets ([basics](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS1.pdf), [tables](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS2.pdf), [intermediate](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS3.pdf), [functions](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS4.pdf), [accessing with Python](http://nelvintan.github.io/files/SQL_CS5.pdf)) is helpful.
- For data structure and algorithms reference and cheatsheet, I looked at these two sources: [(i)](https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference) and [(ii)](https://buildwithmalik.medium.com/i-made-a-python-cheat-sheet-for-data-structures-and-algorithms-useful-for-leetcode-b304754fad9c).
- A cheatsheet for Python can be found [here](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/_media/python:cours:mementopython3-english.pdf).
