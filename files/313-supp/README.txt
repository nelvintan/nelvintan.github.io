- This folder contains all the code used for our simulation experiments.

- Codes are divided into the different sub-folders.

- Under each sub-folder, the respective code will be located there.

*** HOW TO CREATE THE PLOTS ***

- For each plot, we have a "run" script and a "plot" script. 

- To create a plot, we first have to execute the "run" script (e.g., "(run)corr_v_delta.py") which will produce the numpy files that we will use for our plots.

- To produce the plot, we need to execute the "plot" script (e.g., "(plot)corr_v_delta.py") which will produce the plots in pdf form.
