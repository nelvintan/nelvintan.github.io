### Introduction

This is a note on attaining financial independence/freedom in Singapore that I have written for myself[^1].

**What is financial independence?** It means being able to survive financially from one's passive income without having to work any further. To have passive income, one has to figure out the amount of money that needs to be invested -- this is known as the *financial independence (FI) number*. For example, if your investments pay you 4% per year and you require $5000 per month, then your FI number would be (5000 x 12) / 0.04 = $1,500,000.

The components of attaining financial independence involve:
- Emergency fund
- Insurance
- Investing

These topics will be introduced in more detail in the next few sections. In cases where there already exist excellent sources of explanation, I will link them here instead of reinventing the wheel.

[^1]: I was inspired to write this after reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) where I would like to personalize the advice given there for myself.

### Emergency fund

This is cash that one has to set aside in case of emergencies. The recommendation is to keep around 6 months worth of expenditure in cash. Paying off all types of loans would also help towards financial freedom. I would achieve this by being thrifty and putting the remaining funds into savings. Whenever I take funds out to invest, I would then ensure that there is at least 6 months' worth of expenditure left in the bank account. 

Another liquid option is to place one's money in a *money market fund* -- see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=yFsyc_bLw30&ab_channel=KelvinLearnsInvesting) for a good guide on this topic. Money market funds give around the same yearly yield as Singapore saving bonds, T-bills, and fixed deposits from bank, with one major advantage -- you can withdraw your money quickly, with most funds allowing you to withdraw within a day or two. A good Singapore money market fund would be the [Fullerton SGD Cash Fund A](https://www.fullertonfund.com/fund/fullerton-sgd-cash-fund-a/). I would put excess savings (after deducting 6 months' expenditure and are not already invested into other areas) into money market funds since they are liquid and I can get some yield out of them. 

Furthermore, it is important to understand how the CPF works since a portion of your income goes there. An overview of CPF is provided [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/cpf-overview) and a guide to CPF is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jqglfs/a_guide_to_cpf/)

### Insurance

The purpose of insurance is to provide a safety net for undesired circumstances (injury, illness, disability, etc.). An excellent guide to insurance is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/). I believe integrated shield plans, life insurance, and total permanent disability insurance are the crucial ones.

**Remark.** Generally, insurance saving, endowment, and retirement plans are sub-optimal and it might be wise to avoid them. This is explained in greater detail by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/og2hjo/about_insurance_saving_endownment_and_retirement/).

### Investing

A low-risk and time-tested way to invest would be through the use of index funds, which are made up of tons of individual stocks. Hence, there is no stock picking involved and one is essentially buying the entire market. The underlying assumption is that in the long run, the index fund will increase in value, thereby matching/beating inflation, and at the same time, providing the investor with adequate dividends. An excellent guide to index fund investing is provided [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/).

**Remark.** Buying index funds or stocks requires the use of a trading platform and each purchase incurs a commission (a fee one has to pay for the transaction). Links to instructions on how to access and use them are provided shortly later.

My personal preference would be to go for one global fund and one local (Singapore) fund, with the following choices:
- **Global choice:** [Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRA.L)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VWRA.L/). This fund has global diversification, low expense ratio, and decent tax efficiency (compared to US funds). Furthermore, this is an *accumulating fund*, where any dividends paid by companies in the index are automatically reinvested into the fund, rather than being paid out to investors. More details about VWRA.L can be found [here](https://growbeansprout.com/vwra-etf). This can be bought through [IBKR](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php) and a step-by-step youtube guide to using the platform can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqVM4DOspe0&ab_channel=KelvinLearnsInvesting).
- **Local choice:** [SPDR Straits Times Index ETF (ES3.SI)](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/es3.si/). This fund approximately mirrors the Straits Times Index (STI). It is usually compared to [Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF (G3B.SI)](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/G3B.SI/), but I prefer ES3.SI since the fund is larger which might allude to better stability. Note that unlike VWRA.L, ES3.SI is not an accumulating fund. Instead, dividends are paid semi-annually (i.e., twice a year) to its investors. This can be bought through DBS Vickers and a step-by-step youtube guide to using the platform can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmoKvhCw6k&ab_channel=KelvinLearnsInvesting).

**Remark.** One might often wonder if it is worth using roboinvestors instead of investing through trading platforms (as mentioned above). It turns out that if we are planning to invest a large amount of money for the long run, then the cost of roboinvestors eventually exceeds the cost of investing through trading platforms -- for a more concrete comparison, see this [case study](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/t1u7yf/1000_is_all_you_need_for_diy_to_be_cheaper_than/) illustrating that $1000 is all you need for investing through trading plaforms to be cheaper than roboinvestors.
