### Introduction

This is a note on attaining financial independence in Singapore that I have written for myself.

**What is financial independence?** I define it as being able to survive from one's passive income without having to work any further. To have passive income, one has to figure out the amount of money that needs to be invested -- this is known as the *financial independence (FI) number*. For example, it your investments pay you $4%$ per year and you require $5000$ SGD per month, then the FI number would be $(5000\times12)/0.04=1,500,000$ SGD.

The components of attaining financial independence involves:
- Emergency funds
- Insurance
- Investing
The topics will be looked at in more detail in the next few chapters.
