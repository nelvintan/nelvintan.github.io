### Introduction

This is a note on attaining financial independence/freedom in Singapore that I have written for myself[^1].

**What is financial independence?** It means being able to survive financially from one's passive income without having to work any further. To have passive income, one has to figure out the amount of money that needs to be invested -- this is known as the *financial independence (FI) number*. For example, if your investments pay you 4% per year and you require $5000 per month, then your FI number would be (5000 x 12) / 0.04 = $1,500,000.

The components of attaining financial independence involve:
- Emergency fund
- Insurance
- Investing

These topics will be introduced in more detail in the next few sections. In cases where there already exist excellent sources of explanation, I will link them here instead of reinventing the wheel.

[^1]: I was inspired to write this after reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) where I would like to personalize the advice given there for myself.

### Emergency fund

This is cash that one has to set aside in case of emergencies. The recommendation is to keep around 6 months worth of expenditure in cash. Paying off all types of loans would also help towards financial freedom. I would achieve this by being thrifty and putting the remaining funds into savings. Whenever I take funds out to invest, I would then ensure that there is at least 6 months' worth of expenditure left in the bank account. 

**Remark.** Some brokerage firms offer decent yields if you park your money in their accounts (around 3% per annum). An example of this would be the POEMS [cash plus](https://www.poems.com.sg/cash-plus/) account. I would put extra funds (outside of my emergency funds) in such accounts since my funds would be liquid, and I get a nice yield bonus on top of it. Setting up a brokerage account is also crucial for investing (introduced later) so no harm setting it up earlier. 

Furthermore, it is important to understand how the Central Provident Fund (CPF) works since a portion of your income goes there. An overview of CPF is provided [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/cpf-overview) and a guide to CPF is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jqglfs/a_guide_to_cpf/)

### Insurance

The purpose of insurance is to provide a safety net for undesired circumstances (injury, illness, disability, etc.). An excellent guide to insurance is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/). I believe integrated shield plans, life insurance, and total permanent disability insurance are the crucial ones.

Furthermore, Singaporeans born in 1980 or later are automatically covered under CareShield Life from 1 October 2020, or when you turn 30, whichever is later. See this [page](https://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/careshield-life/about-careshield-life.html) for more information.

**Remark.** Generally, insurance saving, endowment, and retirement plans are sub-optimal and it might be wise to avoid them. This is explained in greater detail by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/og2hjo/about_insurance_saving_endownment_and_retirement/).

### Investing

A low-risk and time-tested way to invest would be through the use of index funds, which are made up of tons of individual stocks. Hence, there is no stock picking involved and one is essentially buying the entire market. The underlying assumption is that in the long run, the index fund will increase in value, thereby matching/beating inflation, and at the same time, providing the investor with adequate dividends. An excellent guide to index fund investing is provided [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/).

**Broker.** Buying index funds or stocks require the use of a trading platform and each purchase sometimes incurs a commission (a fee one has to pay for the transaction). I personally use the broker POEMS -- a guide to setting up a POEMS brokerage account can be found [here](https://dollarsandsense.sg/step-step-guide-opening-brokerage-account-poems/).

My personal preference would be to go for the following choices:
- **Global choice:** [Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRA.L)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VWRA.L/). The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the FTSE All-World Index, an international equity index which tracks large and mid-sized company stocks from developed and emerging markets worldwide. This fund can be bought through POEMS.
- **US choice:** [Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD Accumulation (VUAA.L)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUAA.L/). The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of US stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large US companies. This fund can be bought through POEMS.
- **Local choice:** [SPDR Straits Times Index ETF (ES3.SI)](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/es3.si/). This fund approximately mirrors the Straits Times Index (STI). It is usually compared to [Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF (G3B.SI)](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/G3B.SI/), but I prefer ES3.SI since the fund is larger which might allude to better stability. This fund can be bought through POEMS.

**Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS).** This is a voluntary scheme that complements the CPF, where we can contribute a varying amount (subject to a cap) every year -- the contributions may be used to purchase various investment instruments. The SRS offers attractive tax benefits. Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief, investment returns are accumulated tax-free (with the exception of Singapore dividends), and only 50% of the withdrawals from SRS are taxable at retirement. More details can be found [here](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/special-tax-schemes/srs-contributions). The steps to setting up SRS with POEMS are:
- Open up an account (with either DBS, OCBC, or UOB). I went with DBS, the DBS instructions are listed [here](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-account-srs-account-opening.html).
- Link one's POEMS account with one's SRS account -- the instructions are listed [here](https://www.poems.com.sg/release-notes/poems-online-services-quick-reference-guide/#srscpf).
- After both steps are completed, one can log into POEMS and start investing. To use funds from your SRS account, select payment type as SRS when purchasing investments.

(**Note.** ES3.SI introduced above can be bought using one's SRS funds -- this is personally what I use my SRS funds for.) 

**Roboinvestors.** One might often wonder if it is worth using roboinvestors instead of investing through trading platforms (as mentioned above). It turns out that if we are planning to invest a large amount of money for the long run, then the cost of roboinvestors eventually exceeds the cost of investing through trading platforms -- for a more concrete comparison, see this [case study](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/t1u7yf/1000_is_all_you_need_for_diy_to_be_cheaper_than/) illustrating that $1000 is all you need for investing through trading plaforms to be cheaper than roboinvestors.
