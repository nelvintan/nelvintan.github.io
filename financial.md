### Introduction

This is a note on attaining financial independence in Singapore that I have written for myself[^1].

**What is financial independence?** I define it as being able to survive from one's passive income without having to work any further. To have passive income, one has to figure out the amount of money that needs to be invested -- this is known as the *financial independence (FI) number*. For example, it your investments pay you 4% per year and you require 5000SGD per month, then the FI number would be (5000 x 12)/0.04=1,500,000SGD.

The components of attaining financial independence involves:
- Emergency funds
- Insurance
- Investing

The topics will be looked at in more detail in the next few chapters. In cases where there are excellent sources of explanation, I would link them here instead of reinventing the wheel.

[^1]: I was inspired to write this after reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) where the I would like to personalize the advice given there for myself.

### Emergency fund

This is cash that one has to set aside in case of emergencies. The recommendation is to keep around 6-12 months worth of expenditure. Paying off all types of loan would also help towards this venture.

I personally would achieve by being thrifty and putting the remaining funds to savings. Whenever I take funds out to invest, I would then ensure that there are at least one year worth of expenditure left in the bank. Furthermore, it is of importance to understand how the CPF works since a portion of your income goes there. An overview of CPF is provided [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/cpf-overview) and a guide to CPF is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jqglfs/a_guide_to_cpf/)

### Insurance

The purpose of insurance is to provide a safety monetary net for undesired circumstance (injury, illness, diability, etc). An excellent guide to insurance is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/). Personally, I think integrated shield plans, life, total permanent disability insurances are are the crucial ones.

**Remark:** Generally, insurance saving, endownment and retirement plans are sub-optimal and it would be wise to avoid them. This is explained in greater detail by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/og2hjo/about_insurance_saving_endownment_and_retirement/).

### Investing

A low risk and time-tested way to invest would be true the use of index funds, which are made up of tons of individual stock. Hence, there is no stock picking and one is essentially just buying the whole market. The underlying assumption is that in the long run, the index fund will increase in value, thereby matching/beating inflation. An excellant guide to index fund investing is provided [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/).

Note: buying index funds or stocks require the use of a trading platform and each purchase incurs comission (a fee one has to pay for the transaction).
