### Introduction

This is a note on attaining financial independence in Singapore that I have written for myself[^1].

**What is financial independence?** It means being able to survive financially from one's passive income without having to work any further. To have passive income, one has to figure out the amount of money that needs to be invested -- this is known as the *financial independence (FI) number*. For example, if your investments pay you 4% per year and you require 5000 SGD per month, then your FI number would be (5000 x 12) / 0.04 = 1,500,000 SGD.

The components of attaining financial independence involve:
- Emergency fund
- Insurance
- Investing

These topics will be introduced in more detail in the next few sections. In cases where there already exist excellent sources of explanation, I will link them here instead of reinventing the wheel.

[^1]: I was inspired to write this after reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) where I would like to personalize the advice given there for myself.

### Emergency fund

This is cash that one has to set aside in case of emergencies. The recommendation is to keep around 6-12 months worth of expenditure. Paying off all types of loans would also help towards this venture.

I would achieve this by being thrifty and putting the remaining funds into savings. Whenever I take funds out to invest, I would then ensure that there is at least one year's worth of expenditure left in the bank. Furthermore, it is important to understand how the CPF works since a portion of your income goes there. An overview of CPF is provided [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/cpf-overview) and a guide to CPF is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jqglfs/a_guide_to_cpf/)

### Insurance

The purpose of insurance is to provide a safety net for undesired circumstances (injury, illness, disability, etc.). An excellent guide to insurance is provided [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/). I believe integrated shield plans, life insurance, and total permanent disability insurance are the crucial ones.

**Remark.** Generally, insurance saving, endowment, and retirement plans are sub-optimal and it might be wise to avoid them. This is explained in greater detail by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/og2hjo/about_insurance_saving_endownment_and_retirement/).

### Investing

A low-risk and time-tested way to invest would be through the use of index funds, which are made up of tons of individual stocks. Hence, there is no stock picking involved and one is essentially buying the entire market. The underlying assumption is that in the long run, the index fund will increase in value, thereby matching/beating inflation, and at the same time, providing the investor with adequate dividends. An excellent guide to index fund investing is provided [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/).

**Remark.** Buying index funds or stocks requires the use of a trading platform and each purchase incurs a commission (a fee one has to pay for the transaction). [Here](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2019/6/opening-brokerage-and-cdp-accounts) is a guide on how to start trading in Singapore -- one simple and popular option is the DBS Vickers.
