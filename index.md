## About Me:

<img align="right" width="20%" height="auto" src="https://nelvintan.github.io/images/profile.png">

I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), in the [Signal Processing and Communications](https://www-sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (SigProC) Laboratory. I was previously an undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of information theory and statistics. More specifically, my research investigates the fundamental limits and algorithmic performances of statistical algorithms. The main themes are:
- Information Theory
- Statistical Learning
- High-Dimensional Statistics
