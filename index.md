## About Me:

I am currently an undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of information theory and statistics. More specifically, my research investigates the fundamental limits and algorithmic performances of statistical algorithms. The main themes in my interests include:
- Information Theory
- Statistical Learning
- High-Dimensional Statistics
