<img align="right" width="20%" height="auto" src="https://nelvintan.github.io/images/profile.png">

I am currently an undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of information theory and statistics. More specifically, my research investigates the fundamental limits and algorithmic performances of statistical algorithms. The main themes are:
- Information Theory
- Statistical Learning
- High-Dimensional Statistics
