## About Me:

I am currently an undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of information theory and statistics. More specifically, my research investigates the fundamental limits and algorithmic performances of statistical algorithms. The main themes are:
- Information Theory
- Statistical Learning
- High-Dimensional Statistics

## Publications:

Publications are listed in reverse chronological order. 

### Journal Papers:

- **Near optimal sparsity-constrained group testing: improved bounds and algorithms**, Oliver Gebhard, Max Hahn-Klimroth, Olaf Parczyk, Manuel Penschuck, Maurice Rolvien, Jonathan Scarlett, and Nelvin Tan. \[[**arxiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11860)\]

### Conference Papers:

- **Near-Optimal Sparse Adaptive Group Testing**, Nelvin Tan and Jonathan Scarlett. _International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), 2020._ \[[**arxiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03119v1)\]
